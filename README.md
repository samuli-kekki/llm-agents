# Claude Agents

This repository contains code that puts two or more instances of very simple Claude "agents" to talk to each other. With the default settings the agents act as a shopkeeper of an ice cream truck and a customer.

To run, please install the dependencies (anthropic SDK) and run main.py.

The goal was to learn about the Anthropic SDK, the effect of the system prompt, to see whether the agents could maintain a conversation, and to have fun.

# Example Output

It is a sunny day. A customer is approaching an ice cream truck.

<b>Shopkeeper</b>: Well, hello there, my good fellow! Welcome to Marty's Marvelous Frozen Delights on Wheels! What can I do for you on this scorching day? Perhaps a nice scoop of our famous "Eye-Popping Pistachio" or a lick of our "Hunchback Hazelnut"? Come now, don't be shy, we're all melting out here!

<b>Customer</b>: Oh, good heavens! It's about time someone showed up to rescue us from this infernal heat! I've been standing here so long I'm beginning to feel like one of your melted confections. Now, listen carefully, because I'm only going to say this once: I want the largest, coldest, most astronomically refreshing ice cream you have in that rolling freezer of yours. And please, spare me the ridiculous names. I don't care if it's called "Penguin's Pyjamas" or "Frosty's Underpants," just give me something before I spontaneously combust! And do hurry up, will you? I haven't got all day to stand here watching you fumble about like a one-armed juggler!

<b>Shopkeeper</b>: My, my, aren't we a bundle of sunshine on this sweltering day! Fear not, my impatient patron, for I have just the thing to cool your temper and your tongue! Behold, our colossal "Mount Everest Extravaganza"! It's so massive, it comes with its own Sherpa guide and oxygen tank! Now, would you like that served in a cone, a bucket, or perhaps a small swimming pool? And do be careful not to get brain freeze, we wouldn't want to risk damaging that charming personality of yours!

<b>Customer</b>: Oh, splendid! A "Mount Everest Extravaganza," is it? How unutterably thrilling. I suppose next you'll be offering me a complimentary pair of crampons and an ice axe to go with it? Look, I don't need a mountaineering expedition, I need an ice cream! Just scoop the blasted thing into the largest container you have and be done with it. And spare me your witticisms about my personality - I'll have you know it's been carefully cultivated through years of dealing with incompetent service providers. Now, come on, chop chop! I haven't got all day to stand here melting like a forgotten lolly on a radiator!

<b>Shopkeeper</b>: Right-o, one "Cantankerous Customer Cooldown" coming up! I'll just grab our industrial-sized trough and start shoveling. Don't you worry, by the time I'm done, you'll be so thoroughly chilled, icebergs will seem tropical! Now, would you prefer a forklift or a small crane to carry your frozen feast? Oh, and do mind the penguins, they tend to nest in our larger servings. There you are, one glacier-sized helping of our finest frozen fare. That'll be eleventy-billion pounds, please - cash, credit, or perhaps your firstborn child?

<b>Customer</b>: Oh, for heaven's sake! Eleventy-billion pounds? Did you pluck that number from the same fantasy land where you concocted these preposterous flavors? I'd sooner pay with my sanity, which I fear I've already lost during this excruciating exchange. Look here, you frosty fiend, just hand over the ice cream before it melts into a puddle of broken dreams and wasted time. And keep your penguins, I've enough trouble with the pigeons at home. Now, let's conclude this frozen farce before the next ice age, shall we? Here's a tenner, keep the change - you'll need it to fund your clearly necessary psychiatric evaluation!

<b>Shopkeeper</b>: Very well, one "Chilly Churl's Chosen Chunk" coming right up! Here's your glacial delight, handle with care - it's heavier than my aunt Mildred after Christmas dinner. Your change, good sir, I'll donate to the "Help Humorless Humans Heal" charity. Do enjoy your ice cream before it becomes a lukewarm soup. And remember, if you ever need a good laugh or a brain freeze, Marty's Marvelous Frozen Delights will be here, turning frowns upside down and confusing taste buds everywhere!

<b>Customer</b>: Well, it's about time! I'll take my frozen monstrosity and be off before you subject me to any more of your mind-numbing prattle. And don't you worry about my enjoyment - I'll savor every bite, if only to wash away the bad taste this interaction has left in my mouth. Good day to you, and may your next customer have the patience of a saint and the hearing of a deaf hippo!

<b>Shopkeeper</b>: Toodle-oo, my frosty-hearted friend! Do come again when you're ready to trade that pickle for a popsicle!
